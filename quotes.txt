[...] because of the simple fact that you are human, you find yourself heir to an inherent unsatisfactoriness
in life that simply will not go away. You can suppress it from your awareness for a time; you can distract
yourself for hours on end, but it always comes back, and usually when you least expect it. All of a sudden,
seemingly out of the blue, you sit up, take stock, and realize your actual situation in life.

Life seems to be a perpetual struggle, an enormous effort against staggering odds. And what is our solution to
all this dissatisfaction? We get stuck in the “if only” syndrome. If only I had more money, then I would
be happy. If only I could find somebody who really loved me; if only I could lose twenty pounds; if only [...]

[change] is the nature of the universe. But human culture has taught some odd responses to this endless
flowing. We categorize experiences. We try to stick each perception, every mental change in this
endless flow, into one of three mental pigeon holes: it is good, bad, or neutral. Then, according to which box
we stick it in, we perceive with a set of fixed habitual mental responses.

In our society, we are great believers in education. We believe that knowledge makes a person civilized.
Civilization, however, polishes a person only superficially. Subject our noble and sophisticated gentleperson
to the stresses of war or economic collapse, and see what happens. It is one thing to obey the law because
you know the penalties and fear the consequences; it is something else entirely to obey the law because you
have cleansed yourself from the greed that would make you steal and the hatred that would make you kill.

Meditation is called the Great Teacher. It is the cleansing crucible fire that works slowly but surely,
through understanding. The greater your understanding, the more flexible and tolerant, the more compassionate
you can be. You become like a perfect parent or an ideal teacher. You are ready to forgive and forget. You feel love
toward others because you understand them, and you understand others because you have understood yourself.

Meditation is intended to purify the mind. It cleanses the thought process of what can be called psychic
irritants, things like greed, hatred, and jealousy, which keep you snarled up in emotional bondage. Meditation
brings the mind to a state of tranquil awareness, a state of concentration and insight.

You can't ever get everything you want. It is impossible. Luckily, there is another option. You can learn to control
your mind, to step outside of the endless cycle of desire and aversion. You can learn not to want what
you want, to recognize desires but not be controlled by them.

If a particular perception has been labeled “good”, then we try to freeze time right there. We grab onto that
particular thought, fondle it, hold it, and we try to keep it from escaping. When that does not work,
we go all-out in an effort to repeat the experience that caused the thought. Let us call this mental habit
“grasping”.

Take any moment when you feel really fulfilled and examine it closely. Down under the joy, you will find
that subtle, all-pervasive undercurrent of tension that no matter how great this moment is, it is going to end.
--
The person who waits to become totally moral before he begins to meditate is waiting for a situation that will
never arise. The ancient sages say this person is like a man waiting for the ocean to become calm so that he
can take a bath.

Meditation is running straight into reality. It does not insulate you from the pain of life but rather allows
you to delve so deeply into life and all its aspects that you pierce the pain barrier and go beyond
suffering.
--
The ego has a way of turning the loftiest activities into trash if it is allowed free range. Through meditation,
we become aware of ourselves exactly as we are, by waking up to the numerous subtle ways that we act out our
own selfishness. Then we truly begin to be genuinely selfless. Cleaning yourself of selfishness is not a
selfish activity.
--
We see life through a screen of thoughts and concepts, and we mistake those mental objects for reality. We get so
caught up in this endless thought-stream that reality flows by unnoticed. We spend our time engrossed in activity,
caught up in an eternal pursuit of pleasure and gratification and eternal flight from pain and unpleasantness.
--
Then one day you look around you. Your skin is wrinkled and your joints ache. [...] So you pine for lost youth,
cry when your possessions are gone. Where does this pain come from? It comes from your own inattention. You
failed to look closely at life. You failed to observe the constantly shifting flow of the world as it passed by.

Our human perceptual habits are remarkably stupid in some ways. We tune out 99 percent of all the sensory stimuli
we actually receive, and we solidify the remainder into discrete mental objects. Then we react to those mental
objects in programmed, habitual ways.
--
A close inspection reveals that we have done the same thing to “me” that we have done to all other perceptions. We
have taken a flowing vortex of thought, feeling, and sensation and solidified that into a mental construct. Then
we have stuck a label onto it: “me”.
--
Accept your feelings, even the ones you wish you did not have. Accept your experiences, even the ones you hate.
Don't condemn yourself for having human flaws and failings. Learn to see all the phenomena in the mind as being
perfectly natural and understandable. Try to exercise a disinterested acceptance at all times with respect to
everything you experience.
--
Question everything. Take nothing for granted. Don't believe anything because it sounds wise and pious and some
holy man said it. See for yourself. That does not mean that you should be cynical, impudent, or irreverent. It
means you should be empirical.
--
Ordinary human thinking is full of greed, jealousy, and pride. A man seeing another man on the street may immediately
think, “He is better looking than I am”. The instant result is envy or shame. [...] This sort of comparison is 
a mental habit, and it leads directly to ill feeling of one sort or another: greed, envy, pride, jealousy, or hatred.
--
When we [...] perceive any sensory object, we are not to dwell upon it in the ordinary egoistic way. We should
rather examine the very process of perception itself. We should watch what that object does to our senses and our
perception. We should watch the feelings that arise and the mental activities that follow.
